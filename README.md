# Aerea Nexus: The Definitive Framework for Deno Development Synergy

Welcome to Aerea Nexus, a powerful Deno development framework meticulously crafted to eliminate "framework choice paralysis" and empower developers to focus purely on innovation and creation. We believe in providing a prescriptive yet flexible ecosystem where every component is curated and harmonized to work seamlessly together, fostering true development synergy.

## About Aerea Nexus

Aerea Nexus is more than just a collection of technologies; it's an opinionated system designed to streamline your development workflow. By establishing clear architectural decisions and providing a "paved road" for common development tasks, Aerea Nexus allows you to bypass initial setup complexities and dive directly into building robust, scalable, and consistent applications with confidence.

Our core philosophy is to offer a definitive approach to Deno development, ensuring that the underlying stack is not only best-of-breed but also deeply integrated for optimal performance and developer experience.

## Project Structure & Core Technologies

Aerea Nexus is built as a comprehensive monorepo, with the nexus directory serving as its root. This structure ensures clear separation of concerns, promotes independent development cycles, and facilitates autonomous deployment for each component.

Each sub-repository is designed to be self-contained, including its own Docker and Kubernetes-related files, enabling independent build, testing, and deployment.

Here's an overview of the key sub-repos and their roles:

### `app` (Tauri Project):

Purpose: Dedicated to building cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Tauri. It integrates shared UI and UX components to deliver native experiences.

Technologies: Tauri, Deno.

### `cli` (Cliffy-based Project):

Purpose: Houses powerful command-line interface (CLI) tools built with Deno's Cliffy. These tools streamline development workflows, automate tasks, and provide administrative utilities.

Technologies: Deno, Cliffy.

### `data` (SurrealDB related):

Purpose: Manages the entire database layer using SurrealDB. This includes schema definitions, migrations, and robust tooling for launching and managing SurrealDB instances.

Technologies: SurrealDB, Deno (for SurrealQL tooling).

### `docs` (Framework Documentation):

Purpose: The central hub for comprehensive documentation related to the Aerea Nexus framework. This includes guides, architectural overviews, API references, and best practices.

Technologies: (e.g., Docusaurus, VitePress, or a custom Deno-based static site generator).

### `logic` (Core Business Logic - Danet Project):

Purpose: Contains the backend business logic and API services, powered by the Deno Danet framework. This is the core intelligence handling computations and data interactions.

Technologies: Deno, Danet.

### `shared` (Reusable Code & Types):

Purpose: A critical repository for common utilities, TypeScript type definitions, constants, and error handling patterns consumed across multiple other sub-repos.

Sub-folders:

#### `types`: All shared TypeScript interfaces, enums, and type definitions.

#### `utils`: Generic helper functions and utility modules.

#### `constants`: Global constants or configuration values.

#### `errors`: Standardized error classes and patterns.

Technologies: Deno, TypeScript.

### `ui` (User Interface Components - DaisyUI Fork):

Purpose: Focuses on the visual components and design system. As a fork of DaisyUI, it provides a consistent aesthetic and reusable UI elements across all client applications.

Technologies: DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS), Deno (for potential build tooling).

### `ux` (User Experience & Reactivity - Datastar Fork):

Purpose: Manages the interactivity layer that defines the dynamic "feel" and responsiveness of applications. As a fork of Datastar, it embodies the reactive frontend logic that brings your UI to life.

Technologies: Datastar, Deno (for potential build tooling).

### `web` (Web Client Application / PWAs):

Purpose: The dedicated sub-repository for the browser-based client application, assembling UI and UX components into a full-fledged web experience.

Technologies: Deno (for serving/bundling), HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
